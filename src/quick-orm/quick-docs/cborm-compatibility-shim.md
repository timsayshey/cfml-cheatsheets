# CBORM Compatibility Shim

To assist you in migrating from CBORM, Quick ships with a small compatibility shim. To use it, have your entity extend 'quick.models.CBORMCompatEntity`. This will map common CBORM methods to their Quick counterparts as well as provide a partial CriteriaBuilder shim. The compatibility shim does not cover differences in properties or relationships.
