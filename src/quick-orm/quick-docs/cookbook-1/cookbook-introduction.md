# Introduction

The cookbook is a place to show examples of using Quick in practice.  Each cookbook entry will include a short description of the problem to solve or use case and one or more code snippets showing the code.

The cookbook is not meant to teach you the basics of Quick or show you the method signatures.  That is the purpose of the Guide and API Docs, respectively.  The cookbook is meant to show you advanced and specific use cases.

Additionally, this is a great place to contribute to Quick!  If you have solved a particular use case, send in a pull request and add it to the cookbook!  We only ask that you take the time to simplify your example as much as you can.  This usually means removing any custom naming convention for your attributes, tables, and entities.
