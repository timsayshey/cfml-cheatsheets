# hasManyThrough

A 'hasManyThrough' relationship is a 'many-to-many' relationship. It is used when you want to access a related entity through another entity. The most common example for this is through a pivot table. For instance, a 'User' may have multiple 'Permissions' via a 'UserPermission' entity. This allows you to store additional data on the 'UserPermission' entity, like a 'createdDate' .

```javascript
// User.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function permissions() {
       return hasManyThrough( "Permission" );
    }

}
```

```javascript
// Permission.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function users() {
       return hasManyThrough( "User" );
    }

}
```

```javascript
// UserPermission.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function user() {
        return belongsTo( "User" );
    }

    function permission() {
        return belongsTo( "Permission" );
    }

}
```

The first value passed to 'hasManyThrough' is a WireBox mapping to the related entity.

The second value passed is a WireBox mapping to the intermediate entity.

Quick determines the foreign key of the relationship based on the entity name and key values. In this case, the 'Permission' entity is assumed to have a 'permissionId' foreign key. You can override this by passing a foreign key in as the third argument:

```javascript
return hasManyThrough("Permission", "UserPermission", "FK_permissionID");
```

The 'secondKey' is also determined by Quick. It is the foreign key of the current entity for the intermediate entity's table. In our example, this would be 'userId`, since 'User' is our entity and it is for the 'UserPermissions' table. You can override this by passing in the 'secondKey' as the fourth argument.

```javascript
return hasManyThrough(
    "Permission",
    "UserPermission",
    "FK_permissionID",
    "FK_userID"
);
```

Lastly, the 'localKey' and 'secondLocalKey' are the primary keys of the entity and the intermediate entities. Usually this is just 'id`. You can override these as the fifth and sixth argument.

```text
return hasManyThrough(
    relationName = "Permission",
    intermeediateName = "UserPermission",
    firstKey = "FK_permissionID", // foreign key on the UserPermission table
    secondKey = "FK_userID", // foreign key on the Permission table
    localKey = "userID", // local key on the owning entity table
    secondLocalKey = "id" // local key on the UserPermission table
);
```

The inverse of 'hasManyThrough' is also 'hasManyThrough`. A note that the intermediate entity would use 'belongsTo' relationships to link back to each side of the 'hasManyThrough' relationship. These relationships are not needed to use a 'hasManyThrough' relationship.
