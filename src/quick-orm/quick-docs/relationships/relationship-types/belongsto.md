# belongsTo

A 'belongsTo' relationship is a 'many-to-one' relationship. For instance, a 'Post' may belong to a 'User`.

```javascript
// Post.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function user() {
       return belongsTo( "User" );
    }

}
```

The first value passed to 'belongsTo' is a WireBox mapping to the related entity.

Quick determines the foreign key of the relationship based on the entity name and key values. In this case, the 'Post' entity is assumed to have a 'userId' foreign key. You can override this by passing a foreign key in as the second argument:

```javascript
return belongsTo("User", "FK_userID");
```

If your parent entity does not use 'id' as its primary key, or you wish to join the child entity to a different column, you may pass a third argument to the 'belongsTo' method specifying your parent table's custom key.

```javascript
return belongsTo("User", "FK_userID", "relatedPostId");
```

The inverse of 'belongsTo' is ['hasMany'](hasmany.md) or ['hasOne'](hasone.md).

```javascript
// User.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function posts() {
        return hasMany( "Post" );
    }

    function latestPost() {
        // remember, relationships are just queries!
        return hasOne( "Post" ).orderBy( "createdDate", "desc" );
    }

}
```

## Updating

To update a 'belongsTo' relationship, use the 'associate' method. 'associate' takes the entity to associate as the only argument.

```javascript
var post = getInstance("Post").findOrFail(1);

var user = getInstance("User").findOrFail(1);

post.user().associate(user);

post.save();
```

> **Note:** 'associate' does not automatically save the entity. Make sure to call 'save' when you are ready to persist your changes to the database.

## Removing

To remove a 'belongsTo' relationship, use the 'dissociate' method.

```javascript
var post = getInstance("Post").findOrFail(1);

post.user().dissociate();

post.save();
```

> **Note:** 'dissociate' does not automatically save the entity. Make sure to call 'save' when you are ready to persist your changes to the database.
