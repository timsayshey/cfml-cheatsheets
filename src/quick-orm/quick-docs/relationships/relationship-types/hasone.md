# hasOne

## Defining

A 'hasOne' relationship is a "one-to-one" relationship. For instance, a 'User' entity might have an 'UserProfile' entity attached to it.

```javascript
// User.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function profile() {
       return hasOne( "UserProfile" );
    }

}
```

The first value passed to 'hasOne' is a WireBox mapping to the related entity.

Quick determines the foreign key of the relationship based on the entity name and key values. In this case, the 'UserProfile' entity is assumed to have a 'userId' foreign key. You can override this by passing a foreign key in as the second argument:

```javascript
return hasOne("UserProfile", "FK_userID");
```

If your parent entity does not use 'id' as its primary key, or you wish to join the child entity to a different column, you may pass a third argument to the 'belongsTo' method specifying your parent table's custom key.

```javascript
return belongsTo("UserProfile", "FK_userID", "profile_id");
```

The inverse of 'hasOne' is ['belongsTo'](belongsto.md). It is important to choose the right relationship for your database structure. 'hasOne' assumes that the related model has the foreign key for the relationship.

```javascript
// UserProfile.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function user() {
        return belongsTo( "User" );
    }

}
```
