# polymorphicBelongsTo

A 'polymorphicBelongsTo' relationship is a 'many-to-one' relationship. This relationship is used when an entity can belong to multiple types of entities. The classic example for this type of relationship is 'Posts`, 'Videos`, and 'Comments`. For instance, a 'Comment' may belong to a 'Post' or a 'Video`.

```javascript
// Comment.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function post() {
        return polymorphicBelongsTo( "commentable" );
    }

}
```

The only value passed to 'polymorphicBelongsTo' is a 'prefix' for the polymorphic type. A common convention where is to add 'able' to the end of the entity name, though this is not automatically done. In our example, this prefix is 'commentable`. This tells quick to look for a 'commentable_type' and a 'commentable_id' column in our 'Comment' entity. It stores our entity's mapping as the '_type' and our entity's primary key value as the '_id`.

When retrieving a 'polymorphicBelongsTo' relationship the '_id' is used to retrieve a '_type' from the database.

The inverse of 'polymorphicBelongsTo' is also 'polymorphicHasMany`. It is important to choose the right relationship for your database structure. 'hasOne' assumes that the related model has the foreign key for the relationship.

```javascript
// Post.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function comments() {
       return polymorphicHasMany( "Comment", "commentable" );
    }

}
```

```javascript
// Video.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function comments() {
        return polymorphicHasMany( "Comment", "commentable" );
    }

}
```
