# polymorphicHasMany

A 'polymorphicHasMany' relationship is a 'one-to-many' relationship. This relationship is used when an entity can belong to multiple types of entities. The classic example for this type of relationship is 'Posts`, 'Videos`, and 'Comments`.

```javascript
// Post.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function comments() {
       return polymorphicHasMany( "Comment", "commentable" );
    }

}
```

```javascript
// Video.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function comments() {
        return polymorphicHasMany( "Comment", "commentable" );
    }

}
```

The first value passed to 'polymophicHasMany' is a WireBox mapping to the related entity.

The second value is a 'prefix' for the polymorphic type. A common convention where is to add 'able' to the end of the entity name, though this is not automatically done. In our example, this prefix is 'commentable`. This tells quick to look for a 'commentable_type' and a 'commentable_id' column in our 'Comment' entity. It stores our entity's mapping as the '_type' and our entity's primary key value as the '_id`.

The inverse of 'polymophicHasMany' is 'polymorphicBelongsTo`.

```javascript
// Comment.cfc
component extends="quick.models.BaseEntity" {

    function post() {
        return polymorphicBelongsTo( "commentable" );
    }

}
```
