<h1 id="collections">Collections</h1>
<p>Collections are an optional add on to Quick. To use collections you need to install &#39;cfcollection&#39; and configure it as your &#39;returnFormat`.</p>
<p>&#39;QuickCollection&#39; is a specialized version of <a href="https://www.forgebox.io/view/cfcollection">&#39;CFCollection&#39;</a>. It is a component that smooths over the various CFML engines to provide an extendible, reliable array wrapper with functional programming methods. You may be familiar with methods like &#39;map&#39; (&#39;ArrayMap&#39;), &#39;filter&#39; (&#39;ArrayFilter&#39;), or &#39;reduce&#39; (&#39;ArrayReduce&#39;). These methods work in every CFML engine with &#39;CFCollection`.</p>
<p>Collections are more powerful than plain arrays. There are many methods that can make your work easier. For instance, let&#39;s say you needed to group each active user by the first letter of their username in a list.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var users = getInstance(&quot;User&quot;).all();

users
    .filter(function(user) {
        return user.getActive();
    })
    .pluck(&quot;username&quot;)
    .groupBy(function(username) {
        return left(username, 1);
    });</code></pre>
<p>So powerful! We think you&#39;ll love it.</p>
<h2 id="load">load</h2>
<p>Additionally, &#39;QuickCollection&#39; includes a &#39;load&#39; method. &#39;load&#39; lets you eager load a relationship after executing the initial query.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var posts = getInstance(&quot;Post&quot;).all();

if (someCondition) {
    posts.load(&quot;user&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>This is the same as if you had initially executed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">getInstance(&quot;Post&quot;)
    .with(&quot;user&quot;)
    .all();</code></pre>
<h2 id="renderdata">$renderData</h2>
<p>`QuickCollection&#39; includes a &#39;$renderData&#39; method that lets you return a &#39;QuickCollection&#39; directly from your handler and translates the results and the entities within to a serialized version. Check out more about it in the <a href="serialization.md">Serialization</a> chapter.</p>
