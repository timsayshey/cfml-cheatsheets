<h1 id="retrieving-relationships">Retrieving Relationships</h1>
<p>Relationships can be used in two ways.</p>
<p>The first is as a getter. Calling &#39;user.getPosts()&#39; will execute the relationship, cache the result, and return it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var posts = user.getPosts();</code></pre>
<p>The second is as a relationship. Calling &#39;user.posts()&#39; returns a &#39;Relationship&#39; instance to retrieve the posts that can be further constrained. A &#39;Relationship&#39; is backed by qb as well, so feel free to call any qb method to further constrain the relationship.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var newestPosts = user
    .posts()
    .orderBy( &quot;publishedDate&quot;, &quot;desc&quot; )
    .get();</code></pre>
<p>You can also call the other Quick fetch methods: &#39;first<code>, &#39;firstOrFail</code>, &#39;find`, and &#39;findOrFail&#39; are all supported.  This is especially useful to constrain the entities available to a user by using the user&#39;s relationships:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// This will only find posts the user has written.
var post = user.posts().findOrFail( rc.id );</code></pre>
