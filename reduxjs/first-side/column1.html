<p>Redux version: <strong>4.0.5</strong> - Date <strong>April 2020</strong></p>
<h1 id="general-guideline">GENERAL GUIDELINE</h1>
<p><strong>Why Redux?:</strong> With Redux we manage a single one global store at our application and with this we can deal with the communication&#39;s limitation of unidirectional flux between father and child components.</p>
<p><strong>Single source of truth:</strong> only one state <br/>
<strong>State is immutable (read-only):</strong> only an action can trigger a change, you can&#39;t do it directly  <br/>
<strong>Changes are made with pure functions:</strong> only the reducers can transform the state  <br/></p>

<ul>

<li><span class='color-block'>UI (View)</span> Interface that will be modified according to your state</li>
<li><span class='color-block'>Actions (Dispatch)</span> Every action that calls your reducer to mutate your state</li>
<li><span class='color-block'>Reducer</span> A function (or group of functions) that will mutate the data and send the new data to the store</li>
<li><span class='color-block'>Store</span> Holds the whole state tree of your application</div></li>
